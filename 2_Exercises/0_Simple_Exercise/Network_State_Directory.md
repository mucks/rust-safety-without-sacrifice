# Exercise: Mini ‚ÄúNetwork State‚Äù Directory (Parts 1‚Äì5)

Design a tiny in-memory directory for a budding **network state**. Citizens join regions, can move between them, and some become validators. Keep it simple and stick strictly to concepts from **Setup, Intro, Ownership, Structs & Enums, Collections** (Parts 1‚Äì5).

---

## What you‚Äôll practice
- Variables & mutability; functions & control flow  
- **Ownership**, **borrowing**, and **slices** (`&str`)  
- **Structs & Enums**  
- **Collections**: `Vec`, `String`, `HashMap`

> No traits/generics, no error handling beyond simple booleans, no lifetimes annotations (beyond elision), no async/threads.

---

## Task 1 ‚Äî Model the world

- Create an enum `Role` with variants: `Citizen`, `Validator`, `Founder`.
- Create a struct `Member` with fields:  
  `id: u32`, `name: String`, `role: Role`.
- Create a struct `Network` that stores members by region:  
  `regions: HashMap<String, Vec<Member>>` (maps **region name ‚Üí members**).

**Acceptance criteria**
- Types compile and can be instantiated in `main`.
- `println!("{:?}", ...)` works for quick debugging (you may derive `Debug`).

---

## Task 2 ‚Äî Core operations (methods on `Network`)

Implement the following methods:

1. **`new() -> Self`**  
   Initialize the internal `HashMap`.

2. **`register_member(&mut self, region: &str, member: Member)`**  
   - Insert the `member` into the region‚Äôs vector (create it if missing).  
   - Demonstrates **ownership move** into the collection.

3. **`move_member(&mut self, from: &str, to: &str, id: u32) -> bool`**  
   - Remove the member with `id` from `from`, insert into `to`.  
   - Return `true` if moved, `false` if not found.  
   - Demonstrates moving ownership between vectors.

4. **`count_region(&self, region: &str) -> usize`**  
   - Read-only operation using borrowing.

5. **`members_with_prefix(&self, region: &str, prefix: &str) -> Vec<&Member>`**  
   - Return **borrowed** references to members whose `name` starts with `prefix`.  
   - Uses **slices** (`&str`) and borrowing.

6. **`role_stats(&self) -> (usize, usize, usize)`**  
   - Count `(citizens, validators, founders)` across all regions using `match`.

**Acceptance criteria**
- All functions compile and behave as specified on simple examples.
- No heap clones unless intentional (prefer borrowing for read-only queries).

---

## Task 3 ‚Äî Driver program (`main`)

- Create a `Network`.
- Register at least **5 members** across **2‚Äì3 regions**.
- Make one member join as a `Validator`; make another a `Founder`.
- Call `move_member` to move one member between regions and print the result.
- Print counts per region using `count_region`.
- Demonstrate a **safe ASCII** slice with `&str`, e.g.:
  ```rust
  let name = "Alice";
  let prefix = &name[0..1]; // OK for simple ASCII examples
  ```
- Use `members_with_prefix("ForestCity", "F")` (or any region/prefix you choose) and print the names/ids.
- Print `role_stats()`.

**Acceptance criteria**
- Program runs and prints meaningful output showing each feature.

---

## Task 4 ‚Äî Stretch (still ‚â§ Part 5)

If your students finish early or want an additional challenge, extend the network to include more structure and functionality ‚Äî still staying within the limits of **Parts 1‚Äì5**.

### üß± Stretch A ‚Äî Listing all members

Add a new method to `Network`:

```rust
fn list_all_members(&self) -> Vec<&Member>
```

- It should iterate through all regions and collect borrowed references (`&Member`) into a flat `Vec`.
- Use a simple `for` loop with nested iteration.

**Example:**
```rust
let all = network.list_all_members();
println!("Total members: {}", all.len());
for m in all {
    println!("{} ({:?})", m.name, m.role);
}
```

### üåç Stretch B ‚Äî Region info and alliances

Create a `RegionInfo` struct:
```rust
struct RegionInfo {
    name: String,
    description: String,
}
```

Then, extend your `Network` struct with a new field:
```rust
alliances: Vec<String>,
```

Add a method:
```rust
fn add_alliance(&mut self, alliance: &str)
```

This should push a new alliance name to the `alliances` vector.  
Print the alliances when you display network information.

**Example:**
```rust
network.add_alliance("ForestCity ‚Üî Zuitzerland");
println!("Alliances: {:?}", network.alliances);
```

### ‚úÖ Stretch Acceptance Criteria
- The new functions compile and are demonstrated with example output.
- You use only standard library collections (`Vec`, `HashMap`).
- All borrowing rules and ownership principles still apply.

---

## Hints

Here are some helpful reminders and Rust tricks relevant to this exercise:

### üß≠ Ownership & Borrowing
- Functions taking `&self` are **read-only** (shared borrow).
- Functions taking `&mut self` can **mutate internal data** (exclusive borrow).
- Move ownership only when necessary (e.g. transferring `Member` structs between regions).

### üì¶ Working with HashMaps
- Use `entry` for inserting or updating in one line:
  ```rust
  let region_members = self.regions.entry(region.to_string()).or_insert_with(Vec::new);
  region_members.push(member);
  ```
- `or_insert_with(Vec::new)` creates a new empty `Vec` only when needed.

### üß© Iteration & Filtering
- To find something inside a vector:
  ```rust
  if let Some(idx) = vec.iter().position(|m| m.id == id) {
      vec.remove(idx);
  }
  ```
- To filter by prefix:
  ```rust
  if m.name.starts_with(prefix) { ... }
  ```

### üßµ Debugging & Printing
- Use `#[derive(Debug)]` on structs/enums for quick output.
- Print with:
  ```rust
  println!("{:?}", my_struct);
  ```

### üí° Miscellaneous
- Prefer slices (`&str`) over `String` in function parameters where possible.
- Use pattern matching (`match`) for clean role counting:
  ```rust
  match m.role {
      Role::Citizen => c += 1,
      Role::Validator => v += 1,
      Role::Founder => f += 1,
  }
  ```
- Iterate over the entire map:
  ```rust
  for (region, members) in &self.regions {
      println!("Region: {}", region);
      for m in members {
          println!("  - {}", m.name);
      }
  }
  ```
- Stick to ASCII for string slicing (avoid multibyte UTF-8 issues).

---

## Done when‚Ä¶

- You can:
  - Register and move members,
  - Query counts and prefixes,
  - Summarize role statistics,
  - And your code uses only concepts from **Parts 1‚Äì5**.

### Suggested structure

Place in your exercise 

```
1_Exercises/
  0_Simple_Exercise/
    Network_State_Directory.md
    network-state-directory/
      Cargo.toml

```

Then run:

```bash
cargo run
cargo test
```

### Example Output (for inspiration)

```
Moved Bob to ForestCity? true
ForestCity count: 3
Zuitzerland count: 1
Prospera count: 1
First letter of Alice is 'A'
ForestCity members with prefix 'A':
  - Alice (id 1)
  - Akira (id 2)
Role stats -> Citizens: 3, Validators: 1, Founders: 1
Alliances: ["ForestCity ‚Üî Zuitzerland"]
Total members: 5
```
